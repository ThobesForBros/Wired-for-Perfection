Changing the color of the MC’s eyes is a great, subtle way to show his transformation without breaking the budget. Here are a few more low-cost ideas to make him appear more robotic:  

### **1. Eye Effect Enhancements**  
- **Colored Contact Lenses** – Different shades (icy blue, red, silver) could indicate different stages of transformation.  
- **Digital Editing** – If you have access to basic VFX software, subtle glowing eyes (or a faint flicker effect) could add to the robotic feel.  

### **2. Subtle Body Movement Adjustments**  
- **Delayed Blinking** – The MC could blink less frequently as the transformation progresses, making him appear more unnatural.  
- **Uncanny Head Tilts** – Small, unnatural movements (slight head tilts, stiff posture) can make him feel “off.”  
- **Smoother, Precise Movements** – Encourage the actor to move more fluidly, like a machine executing a command.  

### **3. Skin & Facial Effects**  
- **Makeup or Highlighter** – Slightly paler skin or metallic shimmer (especially under harsh lighting) can create a synthetic look.  
- **Veins or Circuit-Like Marks** – Use eyeliner or thin makeup to create subtle lines along his skin, implying something mechanical beneath.  

### **4. Voice Modifications**  
- **Post-Processing** – Slightly distort or auto-tune his voice at key moments.  
- **Delayed or Repetitive Speech Patterns** – He could occasionally repeat words or phrases, as if his speech is being processed.  

### **5. Sound Design Cues**  
- **Subtle Servo Noises** – A faint whirring or clicking sound when he moves, which can be added in post-production.  
- **Glitch Effects** – Small audio distortions when he speaks or moves too fast.
