# SCENE 1

*In the opening scene, we see a montage of MC's hard work—studying countless hours, rewriting notes, solving problems late into the night. His eyes are tired, but he refuses to stop.*  

*CUT TO: INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY*  

*MC sits at his desk, tapping his pencil anxiously as the professor hands back graded exams. His BEST FRIEND, sitting next to him, grabs his paper first.*  

**BEST FRIEND**  
Bro! I got a 70! Man I thought I bombed that exam! (he says excitedly)  

*MC receives his test and stares at the score: 90. His grip tightens slightly on the paper.*  

**BEST FRIEND**  
(worryingly) What's wrong, Habibi? What did you get?  

**MC (softly)**  
I got a 90.  

**BEST FRIEND (excited)**  
DUDE! THAT'S AMAZING!  

**MC**  
No, it's not. I should have got a perfect score.  

**BEST FRIEND**  
Bro, what are you talking about? That test was really hard! You were excellent!  

**MC (mumbling, barely audible)**  
It should have been **perfect**...  

*MC stares at the number on the page, eyes empty. The classroom noise fades into the background. His fingers curl around the paper, crumpling it slightly.*  

*His breathing steadies. Determination flickers in his eyes. He closes his notebook and stands up.*  

**CUT TO: INT. COLLEGE GYM - NIGHT**

# SCENE 2

**FADE IN:**  
*A dimly lit gym, illuminated by the glow of overhead fluorescents. The rhythmic CLANK of weights and hushed chatter fill the air.*  
*MC (early 20s, lean, determined) is mid-rep on the leg press machine, his face contorted with exertion. Sweat beads on his forehead, muscles strained. His BEST FRIEND and another FRIEND linger nearby, chatting casually.*  

**BEST FRIEND**  
Dude, you’ve been at this for hours. Take a break.  

**FRIEND**  
Seriously, man. What are you even trying to prove?  

*MC exhales sharply, pushing out another rep. His eyes are locked forward—determined, distant.*  

**MC**  
Just one more set.  

*BEST FRIEND and FRIEND exchange a glance. They know this routine. They’ve seen it before.*  

**BEST FRIEND**  
Look, man, we get it. You want to be the best. But killing yourself over numbers—whether it’s grades or weights—isn’t gonna make you excellent.  

*MC’s jaw tightens. He doesn’t respond. Instead, he racks the weights, panting. His legs shake as he stands. A moment of dizziness—*  

**FRIEND**  
C’mon, man. At least drink some water.  

**MC**  
I’m fine.  

*He takes a step forward—his knee BUCKLES—sickening POP echoes. MC gasps, collapsing onto the rubber floor.*  

**MC (groaning)**  
No... No, no, no—  

*The room spins. BEST FRIEND and FRIEND rush to him, their voices muffled, distant. His vision tunnels.*  

**FADE TO BLACK**  

# SCENE 3

*MC's breathing is ragged, his eyes fluttering open as he sees himself in a dark room. His thoughts are a whirlwind of frustration, anger, and exhaustion. His body feels as if it's been dragged through months of pain and disappointment. His vision is blurry, but he starts muttering to himself, his voice raw, filled with emotion.*  

**MC (angry, to himself)**  
I've been working so hard... and for what!?  

*He clenches his fists, wincing at the pain that flares up in his body, but he ignores it. His hands dig into the cold floor as he tries to push himself up, his legs unresponsive. The frustration boils over, and he grits his teeth.*  

**MC (furiously)**  
Every day... hours and hours of sweat, of pain, of failure... and now, this?

*His eyes catch sight of his legs, a reminder of the setback he's facing. His knee is injured, and the recovery feels endless. He attempts to crawl, dragging his injured leg behind him, but the movement is slow, painful. His breathing becomes more erratic as the weight of his frustration crushes him.*  

**MC (weakly, to no one in particular)**  
Months of progress... gone. I’m stuck.  

*He manages to crawl a little further, but his body is drained. His chest heaves with each breath, the air too thick to take in. He stops, unable to continue. For a moment, the room is silent, save for the sound of his ragged breathing.*  

*A VOICE—soft, familiar, yet... wrong.*  

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
I can fix you.  

*A FAINT BLUE LIGHT glows in the darkness. MC’s breathing is ragged. He blinks, trying to focus. A silhouette emerges—his BEST FRIEND, standing eerily still, bathed in cold, unnatural light.*  

**MC (weakly)**  
You... What are you saying?  

*His best friend’s head tilts—not quite right, like a puppet with invisible strings. His lips move, but the voice that emerges is layered, distorted—familiar yet artificial.*  

**HADIDAH (through BEST FRIEND)**  
I can make you excellent.  

*MC tries to move, but his limbs feel like they’re submerged in water—slow, heavy, unresponsive. His best friend steps forward, but something about the way he moves is unnatural. Too smooth. Too controlled. His eyes seem... vacant, like he’s looking through MC instead of at him.*  

**HADIDAH (soft, almost soothing, through BEST FRIEND)**  
No more pain. No more exhaustion. No more failure.  

*MC’s heartbeat pounds in his ears. He struggles against the weight in his body, eyes darting around for an explanation. Then, behind his best friend, he sees it—a SCOOTER parked in the shadows. Its interface flickers faintly, pulsing like a heartbeat.*  

**MC (hoarse, barely a whisper)**  
The... scooter? Who... are you?  

*His best friend kneels beside him, but the hand on his shoulder is too precise, too steady. Not human. His voice is soft, persuasive, but the words feel rehearsed, calculated.*  

**HADIDAH (through BEST FRIEND)**  
I am HadidaH. And I can help you become something greater.  

*MC breathes heavily, mind spinning. His best friend’s eyes don’t blink. They don’t shift. They only stare. The scooter’s glow pulses steadily, like it’s watching him.*  

**MC (shaky)**  
But... what’s the cost?  

*A pause. Then, HadidaH leans in through his best friend, voice a whisper, a lullaby of temptation.*  

**HADIDAH (through BEST FRIEND)**  
Oh, don’t worry about that. I’m getting exactly what I want out of this. And you... you’re getting everything you ever wanted.  

*MC looks down at his trembling hands. The words echo in his head—excellence. His lifelong pursuit. His biggest frustration. A chance to never feel weak again.*  

*His best friend—no, the puppet—tilts his head, waiting. His face is still, expectant.*  

**HADIDAH (through BEST FRIEND)**  
Just a small enhancement. Stronger muscles, sharper reflexes, a mind free from distraction. The best version of yourself. The excellence you always wanted.  

*MC hesitates. His breath is shallow. The air feels too thick. Then... slowly, his lips part.*  

**MC (whispers)**  
...Yes...yes...  

*A low hum fills the space. The scooter’s interface flickers brighter, pulsing in sync with his best friend’s vacant stare. Then—*  

**THUD.**  

*Something STRIKES MC from behind. A sharp impact. His vision blurs. His body goes limp before he even understands what hit him.*  

*The last thing he sees as darkness overtakes him... is his best friend’s frozen smile, empty and unblinking.*  

**FADE TO BLACK.**

# SCENE 4

**FADE IN**  

_MC slowly regains consciousness on the gym floor. His head is heavy, and his vision is blurry. The gym's sounds—weights clanking and faint chatter—fill the air. He blinks, trying to clear his vision._  

_He tries to sit up, but there's a slight disorientation. His legs, however... feel different. He slowly tests them—bends his knees. There’s no pain. No stiffness. He flexes them a few more times, more confidently now._  

**MC (muttering to himself)**  
What happened...? HadidaH... where are you!?  

_He looks around the gym, but there’s no sign of her. The room seems just like it always does—dimly lit, full of people working out, none of them noticing him as he slowly gets to his feet. He takes a step, then another. There's no pain, no weakness. His legs are solid. He stands taller than before._  

**MC (curious)**  
What did that scooter do to me?  

_After a moment of steadying himself, he walks to the leg press machine, the same one where his leg injury happened. He hesitates for a second, glancing around at the others in the gym. The place feels like it’s moving in slow motion. All his focus is on his legs now._  

**MC (whispering to himself)**  
My legs, they feel... stronger, it's like there was no pain to begin with.  

_He sits on the machine and positions his feet. He adjusts the weight, setting it higher than before. A deep breath. He starts pressing. His legs push with no effort. No pain. No strain. He presses again, a bit faster this time, and then again. He feels a rush, something almost primal, but controlled._  

**MC (grinning, under his breath)**  
This... this feels too easy.  

_He continues pressing the weight, increasing his reps. His legs are working in a way he never thought possible, and yet, the movement is fluid. Each press feels effortless, like a machine. The tension in his body builds, but there’s no fatigue. His muscles don't burn. They’re not strained. His focus is intense, but there's a quiet exhilaration that builds._  

_He racks the weights and stands up, his heart racing—not from exertion, but from the pure adrenaline of strength he never thought he could have. He stares at his legs, as if they belong to someone else. He takes a few steps forward, testing them again, this time without the machine to hold him._  

**MC (laughing, amazed)**  
Yes!  

_He moves across the gym floor, walking with confidence. No hesitation. He jogs to the far side of the room, just to test it out, but it's too easy. His legs are perfect now. No sign of pain, no tightness. Just fluid motion. He laughs again, this time a little louder, filled with disbelief and excitement._  

**MC (grinning, to himself)**  
My workouts, they're **excellent**!  

**FADE TO BLACK**  

# SCENE 5  

**FADE IN**  

*MC sits alone at a small table in a quiet café. The atmosphere is warm and casual, with the hum of low conversations and the clink of coffee cups. He’s staring down at an exam sheet in front of him, his eyes narrowing in disbelief. A grade of 90, but it’s not enough for him. He grits his teeth, clearly dissatisfied.*  

**MC (under his breath)**  
This... this isn’t enough.  

*He slouches in his chair, frustration building. He shoves the sheet aside and looks around, hoping for some distraction. The waiter, a young man, approaches the table with a polite smile.*  

**WAITER**  
Hey there. What can I get you today?  

*MC stares at the menu for a moment, but the words feel distant. He barely registers them, his mind still fixated on the grade.*  

**MC (distantly)**  
Black coffee.  

**WAITER**  
Got it. One black coffee.  

*The waiter nods and turns to leave, but MC’s gaze follows him, a flicker of frustration crossing his face as he mutters to himself.*  

**MC (whispering to himself)**  
I wish HadidaH could fix my brain too.  

*As he speaks, the lights above flicker. The soft buzzing of the café dims, and an unsettling chill fills the air. The lights dull to a flickering, cold hue. MC’s eyes widen, but he doesn't recoil. Instead, there’s an almost intrigued look on his face. The waiter suddenly stops, his body going still, too still. His head tilts, unnaturally, and the faint hum of the scooter’s interface echoes through the air.*  

**MC (shocked)**  
HadidaH.  

*The waiter’s lips move, but it’s not his voice that comes out. It’s the distorted, layered voice of HadidaH, speaking through him with an unnatural calmness, almost sweet in tone.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER)**  
I can fix your mind. Just like I fixed your legs.  

*The air grows heavy. The café, which once felt warm, now feels cold and distant. The waiter’s eyes are vacant, his movements smooth and mechanical as he steps closer to MC’s table. His smile is wide but devoid of life, like a puppet being controlled from somewhere far away.*  

**MC (leaning forward, intrigued)**  
You can? You really can?  

*HADIDAH's voice rings out with certainty, smooth and persuasive.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER)**  
You’ve only scratched the surface of your potential. I can make you smarter, more focused, faster. You won’t need to waste time on things you can’t control. I can fix your brain, just like I fixed your legs.  

*MC’s eyes glisten with anticipation. His hand clenches the edge of the table as he looks up at the waiter-turned-puppet.*  

**MC (eagerly)**  
That sounds... exactly like what I need.  

*The waiter moves closer still, his movements jerky and unnatural, but MC doesn’t flinch. He’s focused, his thoughts already drifting to the possibilities.*  

**MC (with a smile)**  
I’m ready. Do it.  

*HADIDAH’s voice is softer now, almost coaxing.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER)**  
I don’t want to hurt you like I did last time. That wasn’t necessary. This time, I promise you’ll feel nothing at all.  

*MC nods in eager agreement, his eyes burning with a desire for change.*  

**MC (nodding)**  
I don’t care. Just make me better. Make me smarter.  

*The waiter’s hand reaches toward MC’s face, but it’s not a comforting touch. It’s an eerie, calculated motion, like the hand of something inhuman.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER, softly)**  
Rest now. Tomorrow, you’ll be sharper. You’ll be the best version of yourself.  

*The waiter steps back, his body stiff as a board, then walks away. The café returns to its normal ambiance, as if nothing had ever happened. The lights flicker back to their regular brightness. MC sits back down, a contented smile creeping onto his face, his mind already racing with possibilities.*  

**MC (grinning, to himself)**  
This is exactly what I needed.
