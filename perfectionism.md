**Scene 0** 
*In the opening scene, we see a montage of MC's hard work. Studying countless hours to get the "perfect" grade*

*MC in class getting his paper from an exam while his friend receives it first* 
Friend 1
  Bro! I got a 70! I thought I bombed it! (he says excitedly) 
MC (receives test & MC looks sad and slightly disappointed)
Friend 1
  (worryingly) What's wrong, Habibi? What did you get? 
MC (softly) 
  I got a 90. 
Friend 1 (excited) 
  DUDE! THAT'S AMAZING! 
MC 
  No, it's not. I should have got a perfect score. 
Friend 1
  Bro, what are you talking about? That test was really hard! You did good! 
MC (mumbling)
  It should have been **perfect**

**Scene 1**
*INT. COLLEGE GYM - NIGHT* 
FADE IN:
*A dimly lit gym, illuminated by the glow of overhead fluorescents. The rhythmic CLANK of weights and hushed chatter fill the air.*
*MC (early 20s, lean, determined) is mid-rep on the leg press machine, his face contorted with exertion. Sweat beads on his forehead, muscles strained. His FRIENDS linger nearby, chatting casually.*

Friend 1
  Dude, you’ve been at this for hours. Take a break.
Friend 2
  Seriously, man. What are you even trying to prove?
*MC exhales sharply, pushing out another rep. His eyes are locked forward—determined, distant.*
MC
  Just one more set.
*He racks the weights, panting. His legs shake as he stands. A moment of dizziness—*
Friend 1
  C’mon, you’re killing yourself over this.
MC
  I’m fine.
*He takes a step forward—his knee BUCKLES—sickening POP echoes. MC gasps, collapsing onto the rubber floor.*
MC (groaning)
  No... No, no, no—
*The room spins. Friends rush to him, their voices muffled, distant. His vision tunnels.*
**FADE TO BLACK**

**Scene 2**
*A VOICE—soft, familiar, yet... wrong.*
VOICE (O.S.)
  I can fix you.
*A FAINT BLUE LIGHT glows in the darkness. MC’s breathing is ragged. He blinks, trying to focus. The silhouette of his BEST FRIEND emerges, eerily still, bathed in cold, unnatural light.*
MC (weakly)
  You... What are you saying?
*His best friend’s head tilts—too smooth, too mechanical. His lips move, but the voice that emerges is layered and distorted.*
BEST Friend (HADIDAH) with Scooter
  I can make you perfect.
*MC’s eyes widen in horror as the blue light pulses, illuminating the metallic glint in his friend’s eyes.*
**SMASH CUT TO BLACK**
---
**Scene 4**  

*MC struggles to move, his limbs heavy as if submerged in water. HadidaH steps forward, voice softer now, almost... reassuring.*  

HADIDAH  
  No more pain. No more exhaustion. No more failure.  

*MC breathes heavily, mind spinning. HadidaH extends a hand.*  

HADIDAH  
  You push yourself so hard, but I can take that burden away. You’ll never have to struggle again. No more injuries. No more disappointment. Just... excellence.  

MC (shaky)  
  But... what’s the cost?  

*HadidaH kneels beside him, placing a hand on his shoulder. The metallic sheen of her fingers catches the light.*  

HADIDAH  
  Just one simple agreement. Give me control, and I will make you more than human. Faster, stronger, smarter. The best version of yourself. The perfection you always wanted.  

*MC looks down at his trembling hands. The words echo in his head—perfection. His lifelong pursuit. His biggest frustration. A chance to never feel weak again.*  

*HadidaH tilts her head, waiting.*  

HADIDAH  
  All you have to do is say yes.  

*MC hesitates. His breath is shallow. A moment of silence stretches between them.*  

MC (whispers)  
  ...Yes.
