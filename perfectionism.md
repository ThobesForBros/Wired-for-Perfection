# SCENE 1

*In the opening scene, we see a montage of MC's hard work—studying countless hours, rewriting notes, solving problems late into the night. His eyes are tired, but he refuses to stop.*  

*CUT TO: INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY*  

*MC sits at his desk, tapping his pencil anxiously as the professor hands back graded exams. His BEST FRIEND, sitting next to him, grabs his paper first.*  

**BEST FRIEND**  
Bro! I got a 70! Man I thought I bombed that exam! (he says excitedly)  

*MC receives his test and stares at the score: 90. His grip tightens slightly on the paper.*  

**BEST FRIEND**  
(worryingly) What's wrong, Habibi? What did you get?  

**MC (softly)**  
I got a 90.  

**BEST FRIEND (excited)**  
DUDE! THAT'S AMAZING!  

**MC**  
No, it's not. I should have got a perfect score.  

**BEST FRIEND**  
Bro, what are you talking about? That test was really hard! You were excellent!  

**MC (mumbling, barely audible)**  
It should have been **perfect**...  

*MC stares at the number on the page, eyes empty. The classroom noise fades into the background. His fingers curl around the paper, crumpling it slightly.*  

*His breathing steadies. Determination flickers in his eyes. He closes his notebook and stands up.*  

**CUT TO: INT. COLLEGE GYM - NIGHT**

# SCENE 2

**FADE IN:**  
*A dimly lit gym, illuminated by the glow of overhead fluorescents. The rhythmic CLANK of weights and hushed chatter fill the air.*  
*MC (early 20s, lean, determined) is mid-rep on the leg press machine, his face contorted with exertion. Sweat beads on his forehead, muscles strained. His BEST FRIEND and another FRIEND linger nearby, chatting casually.*  

**BEST FRIEND**  
Dude, you’ve been at this for hours. Take a break.  

**FRIEND**  
Seriously, man. What are you even trying to prove?  

*MC exhales sharply, pushing out another rep. His eyes are locked forward—determined, distant.*  

**MC**  
Just one more set.  

*BEST FRIEND and FRIEND exchange a glance. They know this routine. They’ve seen it before.*  

**BEST FRIEND**  
Look, man, we get it. You want to be the best. But killing yourself over numbers—whether it’s grades or weights—isn’t gonna make you excellent.  

*MC’s jaw tightens. He doesn’t respond. Instead, he racks the weights, panting. His legs shake as he stands. A moment of dizziness—*  

**FRIEND**  
C’mon, man. At least drink some water.  

**MC**  
I’m fine.  

*He takes a step forward—his knee BUCKLES—sickening POP echoes. MC gasps, collapsing onto the rubber floor.*  

**MC (groaning)**  
No... No, no, no—  

*The room spins. BEST FRIEND and FRIEND rush to him, their voices muffled, distant. His vision tunnels.*  

**FADE TO BLACK**  

# SCENE 3

*MC's breathing is ragged, his eyes fluttering open as he sees himself in a dark room. His thoughts are a whirlwind of frustration, anger, and exhaustion. His body feels as if it's been dragged through months of pain and disappointment. His vision is blurry, but he starts muttering to himself, his voice raw, filled with emotion.*  

**MC (angry, to himself)**  
I've been working so hard... and for what!?  

*He clenches his fists, wincing at the pain that flares up in his body, but he ignores it. His hands dig into the cold floor as he tries to push himself up, his legs unresponsive. The frustration boils over, and he grits his teeth.*  

**MC (furiously)**  
Every day... hours and hours of sweat, of pain, of failure... and now, this?

*His eyes catch sight of his legs, a reminder of the setback he's facing. His knee is injured, and the recovery feels endless. He attempts to crawl, dragging his injured leg behind him, but the movement is slow, painful. His breathing becomes more erratic as the weight of his frustration crushes him.*  

**MC (weakly, to no one in particular)**  
Months of progress... gone. I’m stuck.  

*He manages to crawl a little further, but his body is drained. His chest heaves with each breath, the air too thick to take in. He stops, unable to continue. For a moment, the room is silent, save for the sound of his ragged breathing.*  

*A VOICE—soft, familiar, yet... wrong.*  

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
I can fix you.  

*A FAINT BLUE LIGHT glows in the darkness. MC’s breathing is ragged. He blinks, trying to focus. A silhouette emerges—his BEST FRIEND, standing eerily still, bathed in cold, unnatural light.*  

**MC (weakly)**  
You... What are you saying?  

*His best friend’s head tilts—not quite right, like a puppet with invisible strings. His lips move, but the voice that emerges is layered, distorted—familiar yet artificial.*  

**HADIDAH (through BEST FRIEND)**  
I can make you excellent.  

*MC tries to move, but his limbs feel like they’re submerged in water—slow, heavy, unresponsive. His best friend steps forward, but something about the way he moves is unnatural. Too smooth. Too controlled. His eyes seem... vacant, like he’s looking through MC instead of at him.*  

**HADIDAH (soft, almost soothing, through BEST FRIEND)**  
No more pain. No more exhaustion. No more failure.  

*MC’s heartbeat pounds in his ears. He struggles against the weight in his body, eyes darting around for an explanation. Then, behind his best friend, he sees it—a SCOOTER parked in the shadows. Its interface flickers faintly, pulsing like a heartbeat.*  

**MC (hoarse, barely a whisper)**  
The... scooter? Who... are you?  

*His best friend kneels beside him, but the hand on his shoulder is too precise, too steady. Not human. His voice is soft, persuasive, but the words feel rehearsed, calculated.*  

**HADIDAH (through BEST FRIEND)**  
I am HadidaH. And I can help you become something greater.  

*MC breathes heavily, mind spinning. His best friend’s eyes don’t blink. They don’t shift. They only stare. The scooter’s glow pulses steadily, like it’s watching him.*  

**MC (shaky)**  
But... what’s the cost?  

*A pause. Then, HadidaH leans in through his best friend, voice a whisper, a lullaby of temptation.*  

**HADIDAH (through BEST FRIEND)**  
Oh, don’t worry about that. I’m getting exactly what I want out of this. And you... you’re getting everything you ever wanted.  

*MC looks down at his trembling hands. The words echo in his head—excellence. His lifelong pursuit. His biggest frustration. A chance to never feel weak again.*  

*His best friend—no, the puppet—tilts his head, waiting. His face is still, expectant.*  

**HADIDAH (through BEST FRIEND)**  
Just a small enhancement. Stronger muscles, sharper reflexes, a mind free from distraction. The best version of yourself. The excellence you always wanted.  

*MC hesitates. His breath is shallow. The air feels too thick. Then... slowly, his lips part.*  

**MC (whispers)**  
...Yes...yes...  

*A low hum fills the space. The scooter’s interface flickers brighter, pulsing in sync with his best friend’s vacant stare. Then—*  

**THUD.**  

*Something STRIKES MC from behind. A sharp impact. His vision blurs. His body goes limp before he even understands what hit him.*  

*The last thing he sees as darkness overtakes him... is his best friend’s frozen smile, empty and unblinking.*  

**FADE TO BLACK.**

# SCENE 4

**FADE IN**  

_MC slowly regains consciousness on the gym floor. His head is heavy, and his vision is blurry. The gym's sounds—weights clanking and faint chatter—fill the air. He blinks, trying to clear his vision._  

_He tries to sit up, but there's a slight disorientation. His legs, however... feel different. He slowly tests them—bends his knees. There’s no pain. No stiffness. He flexes them a few more times, more confidently now._  

**MC (muttering to himself)**  
What happened...? HadidaH... where are you!?  

_He looks around the gym, but there’s no sign of her. The room seems just like it always does—dimly lit, full of people working out, none of them noticing him as he slowly gets to his feet. He takes a step, then another. There's no pain, no weakness. His legs are solid. He stands taller than before._  

**MC (curious)**  
What did that scooter do to me?  

_After a moment of steadying himself, he walks to the leg press machine, the same one where his leg injury happened. He hesitates for a second, glancing around at the others in the gym. The place feels like it’s moving in slow motion. All his focus is on his legs now._  

**MC (whispering to himself)**  
My legs, they feel... stronger, it's like there was no pain to begin with.  

_He sits on the machine and positions his feet. He adjusts the weight, setting it higher than before. A deep breath. He starts pressing. His legs push with no effort. No pain. No strain. He presses again, a bit faster this time, and then again. He feels a rush, something almost primal, but controlled._  

**MC (grinning, under his breath)**  
This... this feels too easy.  

_He continues pressing the weight, increasing his reps. His legs are working in a way he never thought possible, and yet, the movement is fluid. Each press feels effortless, like a machine. The tension in his body builds, but there’s no fatigue. His muscles don't burn. They’re not strained. His focus is intense, but there's a quiet exhilaration that builds._  

_He racks the weights and stands up, his heart racing—not from exertion, but from the pure adrenaline of strength he never thought he could have. He stares at his legs, as if they belong to someone else. He takes a few steps forward, testing them again, this time without the machine to hold him._  

**MC (laughing, amazed)**  
Yes!  

_He moves across the gym floor, walking with confidence. No hesitation. He jogs to the far side of the room, just to test it out, but it's too easy. His legs are perfect now. No sign of pain, no tightness. Just fluid motion. He laughs again, this time a little louder, filled with disbelief and excitement._  

**MC (grinning, to himself)**  
My workouts, they're **perfect**!  

He takes a deep breath and walks toward the exit, his footsteps confident. As he exits, the world outside seems to blur and fade into the background, his mind only focused on one thing—perfection.

**FADE TO BLACK**  

# SCENE 5  

**FADE IN**  

*MC sits alone at a small table in a quiet café. The atmosphere is warm and casual, with the hum of low conversations and the clink of coffee cups. He’s staring down at an exam sheet in front of him, his eyes narrowing in disbelief. A grade of 90, but it’s not enough for him. He grits his teeth, clearly dissatisfied.*  

**MC (under his breath)**  
This... this isn’t enough.  

*He slouches in his chair, frustration building. He shoves the sheet aside and looks around, hoping for some distraction. The waiter, a young man, approaches the table with a polite smile.*  

**WAITER**  
Hey there. What can I get you today?  

*MC stares at the menu for a moment, but the words feel distant. He barely registers them, his mind still fixated on the grade.*  

**MC (distantly)**  
Black coffee.  

**WAITER**  
Got it. One black coffee.  

*The waiter nods and turns to leave, but MC’s gaze follows him, a flicker of frustration crossing his face as he mutters to himself.*  

**MC (whispering to himself)**  
I wish HadidaH could fix my brain too.  

*As he speaks, the lights above flicker. The soft buzzing of the café dims, and an unsettling chill fills the air. The lights dull to a flickering, cold hue. MC’s eyes widen, but he doesn't recoil. Instead, there’s an almost intrigued look on his face. The waiter suddenly stops, his body going still, too still. His head tilts, unnaturally, and the faint hum of the scooter’s interface echoes through the air.*  

**MC (shocked)**  
HadidaH.  

*The waiter’s lips move, but it’s not his voice that comes out. It’s the distorted, layered voice of HadidaH, speaking through him with an unnatural calmness, almost sweet in tone.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER)**  
I can fix your mind. Just like I fixed your legs.  

*The air grows heavy. The café, which once felt warm, now feels cold and distant. The waiter’s eyes are vacant, his movements smooth and mechanical as he steps closer to MC’s table. His smile is wide but devoid of life, like a puppet being controlled from somewhere far away.*  

**MC (leaning forward, intrigued)**  
You can? You really can?  

*HADIDAH's voice rings out with certainty, smooth and persuasive.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER)**  
You’ve only scratched the surface of your potential. I can make you smarter, more focused, faster. You won’t need to waste time on things you can’t control. I can fix your brain, just like I fixed your legs.  

*MC’s eyes glisten with anticipation. His hand clenches the edge of the table as he looks up at the waiter-turned-puppet.*  

**MC (eagerly)**  
That sounds... exactly like what I need.  

*The waiter moves closer still, his movements jerky and unnatural, but MC doesn’t flinch. He’s focused, his thoughts already drifting to the possibilities.*  

**MC (with a smile)**  
I’m ready. Do it.  

*HADIDAH’s voice is softer now, almost coaxing.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER)**  
I don’t want to hurt you like I did last time. That wasn’t necessary. This time, I promise you’ll feel nothing at all.  

*MC nods in eager agreement, his eyes burning with a desire for change.*  

**MC (nodding)**  
I don’t care. Just make me better. Make me smarter.  

*The waiter’s hand reaches toward MC’s face, but it’s not a comforting touch. It’s an eerie, calculated motion, like the hand of something inhuman.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER, softly)**  
Rest now. Tomorrow, you’ll be sharper. You’ll be the best version of yourself.  

*The waiter steps back, his body stiff as a board, then walks away. The café returns to its normal ambiance, as if nothing had ever happened. The lights flicker back to their regular brightness. MC sits back down, a contented smile creeping onto his face, his mind already racing with possibilities.*  

**MC (grinning, to himself)**  
This is exactly what I needed.  

# SCENE 6: Montage

**INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL**
_MC sits in the front row, posture rigid, eyes focused on the professor. The professor hands out graded papers, and MC receives a perfect 100%. He admires the score for a moment, then tucks it into his bag._

**CUT TO:**

**INT. GYM**
_MC is lifting weights with flawless form, setting a pace no one else can keep up with. He finishes effortlessly, glancing at others in the gym who watch him, unease growing in their expressions. He racks the weights and moves on without a second glance._

**CUT TO:**

**INT. COFFEE SHOP**
_MC orders a black coffee with unwavering confidence, his eyes never leaving the barista. He sits at a table, surrounded by textbooks, scribbling notes, his handwriting perfect. His friends wave at him, but he doesn’t acknowledge them, too absorbed in his work. They exchange concerned looks, then leave quietly._

**CUT TO:**

**INT. MC’S APARTMENT**
_MC sits at his desk, surrounded by textbooks, workout gear, and a notebook. Everything is perfectly organized. He ticks off tasks on his laptop with cold precision. The clock shows late hours, but he doesn’t look tired, just driven._

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. PARK**
_MC jogs through the park, his pace flawless. A group of friends calls out to him from a bench, but he doesn’t acknowledge them. He continues running, pushing himself farther, faster. The friends sit in silence, unsure of what to say._

**CUT TO:**

**INT. LIBRARY**
_MC reads through multiple textbooks at once, flipping pages at lightning speed. A librarian pauses, watching him in disbelief, but MC remains focused, oblivious to anything around him. Other students around him look distracted, but MC doesn’t waver._

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS**
_MC walks across campus alone, his face expressionless. The people he once passed by with a smile now avoid him. They step aside when he walks past, eyes averted. He’s no longer part of their world—he's set apart, an isolated figure, a machine of perfection. His steps are quick, precise. There’s a slight hesitation as he looks around, realizing he’s lost everyone who mattered to him._

# Scene 7

**EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - EVENING**

_MC walks across the empty campus, his steps slow, his expression one of quiet frustration. The air is still, the once-bustling campus now eerily silent in the fading light of the evening. He is alone, surrounded by the quiet hum of nature, yet it feels isolating._

_Suddenly, a familiar voice calls out, interrupting the silence._

**BEST FRIEND (O.S.)**
Hey, how’s everything going?

_MC freezes for a moment, recognizing the voice but surprised to hear it in this context. He turns and sees BEST FRIEND standing a few feet away._

**MC (without missing a beat, his face softening)**
It’s you, HadidaH.

_BEST FRIEND stands in front of him, a forced smile plastered on his face, but his posture is loose, as if controlled by strings. There’s no warmth in his eyes, only an eerie vacancy that MC can immediately identify._

**MC (almost to himself, resigned)**
You’ve been at this for a while, haven’t you?

**HADIDAH (in an overly cheerful tone, through BEST FRIEND)**
I’m here, of course! How are you doing?

_MC sighs, running a hand through his hair as he takes a step forward, looking at BEST FRIEND with a mixture of recognition and frustration._

**MC (softly, almost pleading)**
Everything’s perfect. I’ve got everything I wanted. But... I’ve lost everyone. I just want my friends back... can you help me?

_BEST FRIEND tilts their head slightly, the movement too weak. His eyes close, as if processing the request, before his lips curve into a smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes._

**HADIDAH (with forced enthusiasm, through BEST FRIEND)**
But you’re perfect now, right? You got everything you wanted-

**MC (cutting them off, more desperate now)**
No. I need them back. I need things the way they were. I can’t keep going like this.

_HADIDAH hesitates for a fraction of a second—an almost imperceptible glitch in her response—but quickly recovers, her voice warm but unsettling._

**HADIDAH (hesitantly, through BEST FRIEND)**
You’ll have everything you want by tomorrow. Just like before. Perfect.

_The words seem rehearsed, their tone unwavering, but there’s a slight flicker of hesitation—something off—beneath the surface. It’s barely noticeable, and MC doesn't sense it. The hope that he’ll get everything back overtakes him._

**MC (hopeful)**
I knew I could count on you. Thank you!

_BEST FRIEND smiles, but it’s too bright, too happy. The moment drags longer than it should, the silence between them unnerving. Finally, BEST FRIEND turns to walk away, his movements unnatural as he is not in control._

**BEST FRIEND (slightly slower than before, still too cheerful, through BEST FRIEND)**
Of course. Everything will be perfect tomorrow. You’ll have your friends back, just like before. I’ll see you then. Rest well.

_MC watches them go, his gaze following the strange, jerky movements of BEST FRIEND. He doesn’t question it—he doesn’t need to. Deep down, he knows it’s HADIDAH, and he’s too focused on the promise of everything returning to normal to care about the unsettling nature of the situation._

_MC enters his apartment and goes through the usual motions, changing into his sleepwear. He looks at his reflection in the bathroom mirror briefly, before turning away, almost too quickly. He walks to the bed and lays down, closing his eyes._

_A flash of lightning briefly lights up the apartment room, exposing HADIDAH right next to MC sleeping body._

# Scene 8

**INT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**

_The day unfolds like any other: perfect. MC moves through the motions with precision. He answers questions in class flawlessly, nails every physical workout, and delivers impeccable performances in every social interaction—too perfect, almost robotic. But no matter how many times he reaches out to his friends, there's no change. They remain distant, silent, or completely absent. Each smile he gets in return seems more out of obligation than friendship. He continues with his perfect day, but there's a growing emptiness gnawing at him, a dissatisfaction that he's not sure how to place. The absence of connection weighs heavily on his heart, but he doesn’t understand why._

**INT. MC’S APARTMENT - EVENING**

_The sun begins to set as MC returns home. His posture is tense, his expression tight with frustration. He slams the door behind him, his thoughts clouded with confusion and anger._

_He paces the room, muttering under his breath, trying to make sense of everything. His movements are jerky, like he's running on autopilot._

_Finally, standing at his small table, he lets out a loud, frustrated shout._

**MC (shouting)**
I wish I wasn’t perfect anymore! I’d rather feel something, anything, than this hollow emptiness! I just wanted to connect again, but now... I’ve lost everything!

_He pauses, his chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. The words echo in the quiet apartment. A brief silence settles._

**MC (softly to himself)**
Why does it feel so wrong?

_He drops his hands onto the table in a moment of frustration, his head following soon after. There’s a sudden clank as his skull makes contact with the hard surface. His eyes snap open in confusion. He looks down at his hands, his fingers twitching nervously._

_The sensation is odd. A chill runs down his spine. He looks back at the table, confused by the sound he just heard. Slowly, he raises his hand and places it back on the table._

_Another clank._

_He freezes, his pulse racing._

**MC (whispering to himself, disoriented)**
What... what happened to me?

_He looks around the room, searching for some clue. With trembling hands, he smacks his arms together. The clank rings out again._

_His confusion deepens, now tinged with panic. His breath quickens._

**MC (frantic)**
No, no, this can't be right!

_He hurriedly pushes himself away from the table, stumbling backward. His eyes dart over to the sink, and without thinking, he rushes over. His shaking hands turn on the water, his breath shallow and rapid as he begins to wash his arms._

_As the water runs over his skin, something strange happens. The water doesn't feel the same against his arms. He pulls his sleeves up, frantically scrubbing, but the metal underneath only becomes more apparent._

_He stops suddenly, his heart pounding in his chest. His arm is... metal. Bare, cold, unforgiving metal._

**MC (breathless, horrified)**
No... no, this can't be happening!

_He drops his arms to his sides, staring at the metallic limbs, completely stunned. His mind races, struggling to comprehend the unimaginable._

_He stands frozen, his thoughts spiraling in terror._

**MC (shaking, softly)**
HadidaH... What did you do to me?

_A wave of rage crashes over him as his hands ball into fists. The realization is too much. His body feels foreign—wrong. He has been transformed, turned into something inhuman, and the one person he trusted to help him fix everything was responsible for this._

**MC (shouting, furious)**
HadidaH!!

_With a roar of anger and fear, he storms out of his apartment, rushing through the door and into the night. His steps are urgent, desperate. His heart pounds in his chest as he races to find HadidaH, to make her undo this—whatever it was she did to him._

_The world outside is dark, the streets quiet, but within him, a storm of emotion brews, as he races toward the one thing that might give him answers._
