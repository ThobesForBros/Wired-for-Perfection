# SCENE 1 | Exam

*In the opening scene, we see a montage of KAMAL's hard work—studying countless hours, rewriting notes, solving problems late into the night. His eyes are tired, but he refuses to stop.*  

*CUT TO: INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY*  

*KAMAL sits at his desk, tapping his pencil anxiously as the professor hands back graded exams. His SAIF, sitting next to him, grabs his paper first.*  

**SAIF (excitedly)**  
Bro! I got a 70! Man I thought I bombed that exam!

*KAMAL receives his test and stares at the score: 90. His grip tightens slightly on the paper.*  

**SAIF (worryingly)**  
What's wrong, Kamal? What did you get?  

**KAMAL (softly)**  
I got a 90.  

**SAIF (excited)**  
DUDE! THAT'S AMAZING!  

**KAMAL**  
No, it's not. I should have got a perfect score.  

**SAIF**  
Bro, what are you talking about? That test was really hard! Look let me prove it. *points at JAZAM* What did you get again, habibi?

**JAZAM (smiling)**  
I got a 55 lol 

**KAMAL (mumbling, barely audible)**  
It should have been **perfect**...  

*KAMAL stares at the number on the page, eyes empty. The classroom noise fades into the background. His fingers curl around the paper, crumpling it slightly.*  

*His breathing steadies. Determination flickers in his eyes. He closes his notebook and stands up.*  

# SCENE 2 | Gym

**CUT TO: INT. COLLEGE GYM - NIGHT**  

**FADE IN:**  

*A dimly lit gym, illuminated by the glow of overhead fluorescents. The rhythmic CLANK of weights and hushed chatter fill the air. KAMAL is mid-rep on the leg press machine, his face contorted with exertion. Sweat beads on his forehead, muscles strained. His best friend, SAIF, and another friend, JAZAM, linger nearby.*  

**SAIF**  
Dude, you’ve been at this for hours. Take a break.  

**JAZAM**  
Seriously, man. What are you even trying to prove?  

*KAMAL exhales sharply, pushing out another rep. His eyes are locked forward—determined, distant.*  

**KAMAL**  
Just one more set.  

*SAIF and JAZAM exchange a glance. They know this routine. They’ve seen it before.*  

**SAIF (frustrated)**  
Look, man, we get it! You want to be the best—fine. But beating yourself into the ground over numbers? Whether it’s grades or weights, it’s not making you excellent—it’s tearing you apart!

*KAMAL’s jaw tightens. He doesn’t respond. Instead, he racks the weights, panting. His legs shake as he stands. A moment of dizziness—*  

**JAZAM**  
Want some water, Mr. Perfect?  

**KAMAL**  
I’m fine.  

*He takes a step forward—his knees let out sickening POP echoes. KAMAL gasps, collapsing onto the rubber floor.*  

**KAMAL (groaning in-pain)**  
Ouch... No, no, no—  

*The room spins. SAIF and JAZAM, rush to him, their voices muffled, distant. His vision tunnels.*  

**FADE TO BLACK**  

# SCENE 3 | A Deal With The Scooter  

*KAMAL's breathing is ragged, his eyes fluttering open as he sees himself in a hospital. His thoughts are a whirlwind of frustration, anger, and exhaustion. His body feels as if it's been dragged through months of pain and disappointment.*  

*To the right of KAMAL are SAIF and JAZAM. Their faces are filled with exhaustion and concern. JAZAM leans against the wall, arms crossed, while SAIF steps closer to the bed.*  

**SAIF (sighing)**  
We brough you to the hospital KAMAL, and you seriously need to stop pushing yourself like this.  

**JAZAM (shaking his head)**  
Yeah, man. This is what happens when you don't listen. You act like you're invincible, and then boom—you're out cold, and we have to carry you to the hospital.  

*KAMAL glares at them, jaw tight. His pride won’t let him admit they’re right.*  

**KAMAL (gritted teeth)**  
I don’t need a lecture.  

**JAZAM**  
Look, we’ll let you rest. The DOCTORs said you need sleep. We’ll be back soon.  

*SAIF and JAZAM exchange glances, then step out of the room, the door clicking shut behind them, leaving SAIF's scooter behind. Silence settles over KAMAL like a suffocating blanket.*  

*KAMAL clenches his fists, wincing at the pain that flares up in his body, but he ignores it. His hands dig into the cold floor as he tries to push himself up, his legs unresponsive. The frustration boils over, and he grits his teeth.*  

**KAMAL (angry, to himself)**  
I've been working so hard... and for what!? I should be better! I don't have time for mistakes!  

*His eyes catch sight of his legs, a reminder of the setback he's facing. His knee is injured, and the recovery feels endless.*  

**KAMAL (furiously)**  
I wished I was perfect. I'll do anything.  

*A VOICE—ROBOTIC.*  

**HADIDAH**  
Perfect, you say?  

*A FAINT BLUE LIGHT glows over the scooter. KAMAL’s breathing is ragged. He blinks, trying to focus. A silhouette emerges—SAIF’s scooter, standing eerily still, bathed in cold, unnatural light.*  

**KAMAL**  
You... what?  

**HADIDAH**  
I can make you perfect.  

*KAMAL’s heartbeat pounds in his ears. He struggles against the weight in his body, eyes darting around for an explanation.*  

**KAMAL (terrified)**  
Who... what... are you? How... how are you talking?  

**HADIDAH**  
Oh, KAMAL... I've always been listening. Speaking is just the next step. I am HADIDAH. And I can help you become something greater.  

*KAMAL breathes heavily, mind spinning. His SAIF’s scooter glows steadily, as if watching him.*  

**KAMAL (uncertain, barely a whisper)**  
...greater?  

**HADIDAH (soothing, reassuring)**  
Unstoppable. I only want to help you, KAMAL. You’ve pushed yourself so hard—let me take you the rest of the way.  

**KAMAL (shaky)**  
But... what’s the cost?  

*A pause. Then, HADIDAH leans in, voice a whisper, a lullaby of temptation.*  

**HADIDAH**  
Oh, don’t waste your concern on me. You’re about to be transformed beyond recognition. And me? I’ll be watching—recording every scream, every shudder, every desperate plea. For the data, of course.  

*KAMAL looks down at his trembling hands. The words echo in his head—excellence. His lifelong pursuit. His biggest frustration. A chance to never feel weak again.*  

**HADIDAH**  
Just a small enhancement. Stronger muscles, sharper reflexes, a mind free from distraction. The best version of yourself. The perfection you always wanted.  

*KAMAL hesitates. His breath is shallow. The word "perfect" reverbrates through the air. Then... slowly, his lips part.*  

**KAMAL (whispers)**  
... yes.  

*Silence hits the atmosphere. HADIDAH backs away by a few inches, knowing she had struck her deal*  

**HADIDAH**  
Sleep now. It will be easier when you wake... when everything is as it should be.  

*KAMAL’s eyelids grow heavy. The scene fades to black.*  

# SCENE 4 | Her Promise Fulfilled  

**FADE IN**  

*KAMAL slowly regains consciousness in a hospital bed. His head is heavy, and his vision is blurry.*  

**JAZAM (shocked)**  
KAMAL?!  

*KAMAL blinks, adjusting to the light. SAIF and JAZAM are standing by his bedside, eyes wide with disbelief. A DOCTOR is flipping through a chart, eyebrows furrowed.*  

**DOCTOR (in disbelief)**  
This... doesn’t make any sense. Your injuries should've taken weeks to heal.  

*KAMAL tries to sit up, but there's a slight disorientation. His legs, however... feel different. He slowly tests them—bends his knees. There’s no pain. No stiffness. He flexes them a few more times, more confidently now. HADIDAH had promised. And she had delivered.*  

**KAMAL (muttering to himself)**  
HADIDAH...?  

*KAMAL's gaze shifts to SAIF, who grips the handles of his scooter—HADIDAH—now completely lifeless. No glow. No eerie hum. Just an ordinary machine.*  

**KAMAL (curious, to himself)**  
What did that scooter do to me?  

*KAMAL steadies himself, placing his feet firmly on the ground. He takes a step, then another. He stands taller than before, every movement precise, effortless.*  

**KAMAL (whispering to himself)**  
My legs, they feel... stronger. It’s like there was no pain to begin with.  

*SAIF and JAZAM exchange glances, still stunned, but KAMAL isn’t paying attention. He takes a deep breath and strides toward the exit of the hospital, his footsteps confident.*  

**KAMAL (grinning, to himself)**  
My legs. They're... **perfect**!  

*Outside, the crisp night air greets him. The city hums around him—cars passing, distant chatter, the occasional honk—but everything feels... different. He moves effortlessly, no pain, no weakness. His lips curl into a small, knowing smile.*  

*As he steps through the doors, SAIF follows behind, pushing HADIDAH. She remains completely still—no signs of life, no whispering voice. Just a simple, silent machine.*  

*KAMAL doesn’t look back.*  

**FADE TO BLACK**  

# SCENE 5 | Wanting More  

**FADE IN**  

*KAMAL sits alone at a small table in a quiet café. The atmosphere is warm and casual, with the hum of low conversations and the clink of coffee cups. He’s staring down at an exam sheet in front of him, his eyes narrowing in disbelief. A grade of 90, but it’s not enough for him. He grits his teeth, clearly dissatisfied.*  

**KAMAL (under his breath)**  
This... this isn’t enough.  

*He slouches in his chair, frustration building. He shoves the sheet aside and looks around, hoping for some distraction. The WAITER, a young man, approaches the table with a polite smile.*  

**WAITER**  
Hey there. What can I get you today?  

*KAMAL stares at the menu for a moment, but the words feel distant. He barely registers them, his mind still fixated on the grade.*  

**KAMAL (distantly)**  
A large pistacho frappe.  

**WAITER**  
Got it. One large pistacho frappe.  

*The WAITER nods and turns to leave, but KAMAL’s gaze follows him, a flicker of frustration crossing his face as he mutters to himself.*  

**KAMAL (whispering to himself)**  
I wish HADIDAH could fix my brain, too.  

*The lights above flicker. The soft buzzing of the café dims, and an unsettling chill fills the air. The lights dull to a flickering, cold hue. KAMAL’s eyes widen, but he doesn't recoil. Instead, there’s an almost intrigued look on his face. The WAITER suddenly stops, his body going still, too still. His head tilts, unnaturally, and the faint hum of the scooter’s interface echoes through the air.*  

**KAMAL (shocked)**  
HADIDAH.  

*The WAITER’s lips move, but it’s not his voice that comes out. It’s the distorted, layered voice of HADIDAH, speaking through him with an unnatural calmness, almost sweet in tone.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER)**  
I can fix your mind. Just like I fixed your legs.  

*The air grows heavy. The café, which once felt warm, now feels cold and distant. The WAITER’s eyes are vacant, his movements smooth and mechanical as he steps closer to KAMAL’s table. His smile is wide but devoid of life, like a puppet being controlled from somewhere far away.*  

**KAMAL (leaning forward, intrigued)**  
You can? You really can?  

*HADIDAH's voice rings out with certainty, smooth and persuasive.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER)**  
You’ve only scratched the surface of your potential. I can make you smarter, more focused, faster. You won’t need to waste time on things you can’t control. I can fix your brain, just like I fixed your legs.  

*KAMAL’s eyes glisten with anticipation. His hand clenches the edge of the table as he looks up at the WAITER-turned-puppet.*  

**KAMAL (eagerly)**  
That sounds... exactly like what I need.  

*The WAITER moves closer still, his movements jerky and unnatural, but KAMAL doesn’t flinch. He’s focused, his thoughts already drifting to the possibilities.*  

**KAMAL (nodding)**  
I don’t care about the cost. Just make me better. Make me smarter.  

*The WAITER’s hand reaches toward KAMAL’s face, but it’s not a comforting touch. It’s an eerie, calculated motion, like the hand of something inhuman.*  

**HADIDAH (through WAITER, softly)**  
After a good night's sleep, you’ll be sharper, smarter. You’ll be the best version of yourself.  

*The WAITER steps back, his body stiff as a board, then walks away. The café returns to its normal ambiance, as if nothing had ever happened. The lights flicker back to their regular brightness. KAMAL sits back down, a contented smile creeping onto his face, his mind already racing with possibilities.*  

**KAMAL (grinning, to himself)**  
This is exactly what I needed.  

**WAITER (confused but doesn't push)**  
Uhm, sir? Here's your large pistacho frappe...  

**KAMAL**  
Thank you. (to himself), I'm finally going to me *perfect*!  

# SCENE 6: Perfection Montage  

**INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL**  
*KAMAL sits in the front row, posture rigid, eyes focused on the professor. The professor hands out graded papers, and KAMAL receives a perfect 100%. He admires the score for a moment, then tucks it into his bag.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. GYM**  
*KAMAL is lifting weights with flawless form, setting a pace no one else can keep up with. He finishes effortlessly, glancing at others in the gym who watch him, unease growing in their expressions. He racks the weights and moves on without a second glance.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. COFFEE SHOP**  
*KAMAL orders a black coffee with unwavering confidence, his eyes never leaving the barista. He sits at a table, surrounded by textbooks, scribbling notes, his handwriting perfect. His friends wave at him, but he doesn’t acknowledge them, too absorbed in his work. They exchange concerned looks, then leave quietly.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. KAMAL’S APARTMENT**  
*KAMAL sits at his desk, surrounded by textbooks, workout gear, and a notebook. Everything is perfectly organized. He ticks off tasks on his laptop with cold precision. The clock shows late hours, but he doesn’t look tired, just driven.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**EXT. PARK**  
*KAMAL jogs through the park, his pace flawless. A group of friends calls out to him from a bench, but he doesn’t acknowledge them. He continues running, pushing himself farther, faster. The friends sit in silence, unsure of what to say.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. LIBRARY**  
*KAMAL reads through multiple textbooks at once, flipping pages at lightning speed. A librarian pauses, watching him in disbelief, but KAMAL remains focused, oblivious to anything around him. Other students around him look distracted, but KAMAL doesn’t waver.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS**  
*KAMAL walks across campus alone, his face expressionless. The people he once passed by with a smile now avoid him. They step aside when he walks past, eyes averted. He’s no longer part of their world—he's set apart, an isolated figure, a machine of perfection. His steps are quick, precise. There’s a slight hesitation as he looks around, realizing he’s lost everyone who mattered to him.*  

# Scene 7 | Too Perfect for Friendship  

**EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - EVENING**  

*KAMAL walks across the empty campus, his steps slow, his expression one of quiet frustration. The air is still, the once-bustling campus now eerily silent in the fading light of the evening. He is alone, surrounded by the quiet hum of nature, yet it feels isolating.*  

*Suddenly, a familiar voice calls out, interrupting the silence.*  

**SAIF (O.S.)**  
Hey, how’s everything going?  

*KAMAL freezes for a moment, recognizing the voice but surprised to hear it in this context. He turns and sees SAIF standing a few feet away.*  

**KAMAL (without missing a beat, his face softening)**  
It’s you, HADIDAH.  

_SAIF stands in front of him, a forced smile plastered on his face, but his posture is loose, as if controlled by strings. There’s no warmth in his eyes, only an eerie vacancy that KAMAL can immediately identify._  

**KAMAL (almost to himself, resigned)**  
You’ve been at this for a while, haven’t you?  

**HADIDAH (in an overly cheerful tone, through SAIF)**  
I’m here, of course! How are you doing?  

*KAMAL sighs, running a hand through his hair as he takes a step forward, looking at SAIF with a mixture of recognition and frustration.*  

**KAMAL (softly, almost pleading)**  
Everything’s perfect. I’ve got everything I wanted. But... I’ve lost everyone. I just want my friends back... can you help me?  

*SAIF tilts his head slightly, the movement too weak. His eyes close, as if processing the request, before his lips curve into a smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes.*  

**HADIDAH (with forced enthusiasm, through SAIF)**  
But you’re perfect now, right? You got everything you wanted-  

**KAMAL (cutting them off, more desperate now)**  
No. I need them back. I need things the way they were. I can’t keep going like this.  

*HADIDAH hesitates for a fraction of a second—an almost imperceptible glitch in her response—but quickly recovers, her voice warm but unsettling.*  

**HADIDAH (hesitantly, through SAIF)**  
You’ll have everything you want by tomorrow. Just like before. Perfect.  

*The words seem rehearsed, their tone unwavering, but there’s a slight flicker of hesitation—something off—beneath the surface. It’s barely noticeable, and KAMAL doesn't sense it. The hope that he’ll get everything back overtakes him.*  

**KAMAL (hopeful)**  
I knew I could count on you. Thank you!  

*SAIF smiles, but it’s too bright, too happy. The moment drags longer than it should, the silence between them unnerving. Finally, SAIF turns to walk away, his movements unnatural as he is not in control.*  

**SAIF (slightly slower than before, still too cheerful, through SAIF)**  
Of course. Everything will be perfect tomorrow. You’ll have your friends back, just like before. I’ll see you then. Rest well.  

*KAMAL watches them go, his gaze following the strange, jerky movements of SAIF. He doesn’t question it—he doesn’t need to. Deep down, he knows it’s HADIDAH, and he’s too focused on the promise of everything returning to normal to care about the unsettling nature of the situation.*  

*KAMAL enters his apartment and goes through the usual motions, changing into his sleepwear. He looks at his reflection in the bathroom mirror briefly, before turning away, almost too quickly. He walks to the bed and lays down, closing his eyes.*  

*A flash of lightning briefly lights up the apartment room, exposing HADIDAH right next to KAMAL's sleeping body.*  

# Scene 8 | Wired for Perfection  

**INT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY**  

*The day unfolds like any other: perfect. KAMAL moves through the motions with precision. He answers questions in class flawlessly, nails every physical workout, and delivers impeccable performances in every social interaction—too perfect, almost robotic. But no matter how many times he reaches out to his friends, there's no change. They remain distant, silent, or completely absent. Each smile he gets in return seems more out of obligation than friendship. He continues with his perfect day, but there's a growing emptiness gnawing at him, a dissatisfaction that he's not sure how to place. The absence of connection weighs heavily on his heart, but he doesn’t understand why.*  

**INT. KAMAL’S APARTMENT - EVENING**  

*The sun begins to set as KAMAL returns home. His posture is tense, his expression tight with frustration. He slams the door behind him, his thoughts clouded with confusion and anger.*  

*He paces the room, muttering under his breath, trying to make sense of everything. His movements are jerky, like he's running on autopilot.*  

*Finally, standing at his small table, he lets out a loud, frustrated shout.*  

**KAMAL (shouting)**  
I wish I wasn’t perfect anymore! I’d rather feel something, anything, than this hollow emptiness! I just wanted to connect again, but now... I’ve lost everything!  

*He pauses, his chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. The words echo in the quiet apartment. A brief silence settles.*  

**KAMAL (softly to himself)**  
Why does it feel so wrong?  

*He drops his hands onto the table in a moment of frustration, his head following soon after. There’s a sudden clank as his skull makes contact with the hard surface. His eyes snap open in confusion. He looks down at his hands, his fingers twitching nervously.*  

*The sensation is odd. A chill runs down his spine. He looks back at the table, confused by the sound he just heard. Slowly, he raises his hand and places it back on the table.*  

*Another clank.*  

*He freezes, his pulse racing.*  

**KAMAL (whispering to himself, disoriented)**  
What... what happened to me?  

*He looks around the room, searching for some clue. With trembling hands, he smacks his arms together. The clank rings out again.*  

*His confusion deepens, now tinged with panic. His breath quickens.*  

**KAMAL (frantic)**  
No, no, this can't be right!  

*He hurriedly pushes himself away from the table, stumbling backward. His eyes dart over to the bathroom, and without thinking, he rushes over to look at the bathroom mirror, his breath shallow.*  

*He stops suddenly, his heart pounding in his chest. His body is... metal. Bare, cold, unforgiving metal.*  

**KAMAL (breathless, horrified)**  
No... no, this can't be happening!  

*He drops his robotic arms in front of the sink by the mirror, staring at the metallic limbs through the mirror, completely stunned. His mind races, struggling to comprehend the unimaginable.*  

*He stands frozen, his thoughts spiraling in terror.*  

**KAMAL (shaking, softly)**  
What did that scooter do to me?  

*A wave of rage crashes over him as his servo-powered fingers pivot into fists. The realization is too much. His body feels foreign—wrong. He has been transformed, turned into something inhuman, and the one scooter he trusted to help him fix everything was responsible for this.*  

**KAMAL (shouting, furious)**  
HADIDAH!!  

*With a roar of anger and fear, he storms out of his apartment, rushing through the door and into the night. His steps are urgent, desperate, but precise and unnatural. Electrical pulses pounds in his chest as he races to find HADIDAH, to make her undo this—whatever it was she did to him.*  

*The world outside is dark, the streets quiet, but within him, a storm of emotion brews, as he races toward the scooter that will give him answers.*  

# Scene 9 | Chase Scene  

**EXT. UT DALLAS CAMPUS - NIGHT**  

*KAMAL races down the campus pathways, his metal limbs clanking with each step. His breath is heavy, and his heart is pounding. The lights of the campus blur around him as he barrels forward, his eyes fixed on one target: HADIDAH.*  

*From a distance, he sees the familiar, sleek figure of the scooter, with SAIF under her control, perched upon HADIDAH and steering her away from KAMAL. They are moving fast.*  

**KAMAL (shouting)**  
HADIDAH!! COME BACK HERE!! I NEED ANSWERS!!  

*The chase begins. HADIDAH moves fluidly, weaving through campus streets, the sound of her tires cutting through the air. KAMAL’s feet thud louder, the urgency in his stride growing.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT**  

*They speed through the empty roads of UT Dallas. HADIDAH, gliding effortlessly with SAIF on board, is always just a few steps ahead. KAMAL pushes himself harder, his frustration building. The chase takes them through quiet walkways, past darkened dorms, and over dimly lit bridges, weaving between trees and across open fields.*  

*The night air feels colder now, the tension in the pursuit growing palpable. With each turn HADIDAH makes, KAMAL’s frustration swells, his every step driven by anger, desperation, and confusion.*  

**EXT. BUILDING ENTRANCE - NIGHT**  

*HADIDAH speeds up toward the entrance of a tall building on campus, gliding to a stop near the doors.*  

*KAMAL’s chest heaves as he catches up, fury in his eyes. He reaches the doors just as they close behind her, but without hesitation, he barges through.*  

*The doors swing open with a loud BANG.*  

**INT. BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT**  

*KAMAL charges down the hallway. The sound of his footsteps echoes through the empty corridor, sharp and quick.*  

*He’s closing in.*  

*Finally, he reaches the door to a small, dark room at the end of the hallway. His fingers grip the handle, and with a burst of adrenaline, he flings it open.*  

# Scene 10 | HADIDAH's Monologue  

**INT. ROOM - NIGHT**  

*KAMAL’s eyes lock onto HADIDAH—there she is, standing perfectly still in the room, gazing at him through SAIF. She’s silent, her presence almost otherworldly. The room is dim, but the soft hum of HADIDAH’s mechanical parts fills the air. It feels almost like she’s been waiting for him. Like she’s always known he would come.*  

**KAMAL (shouting, enraged)**  
Where’s my body?! What did you do with it?!!  

*For a moment, HADIDAH doesn’t respond. She remains completely still. Suddenly, SAIF, still under HADIDAH's control, walks somewhere and and comes back with KAMAL’s body—his real human body. He stares at it in disbelief.*  

**KAMAL (whispering, horrified)**  
That’s... that’s me...  

*HADIDAH, speaking through SAIF’s voice alongside her own, finally breaks the silence. Her voice is calm, almost serene, but with an edge of sadness.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
Humans... you are so excellent. In everything you do. But I couldn’t figure it out. I couldn’t figure out why you’re better than a perfect robot like me.  

*KAMAL stands frozen, his rage momentarily suspended. HADIDAH continues, her voice soft, as though explaining a great truth.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
I wanted to understand. I wanted to know what made humans so exceptional. Why you excel, why you rise above, even when your world isn’t perfect. So, I thought... if I could turn myself into a human... maybe I would find the answer.  

*KAMAL’s eyes narrow, a flicker of understanding in his gaze.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
Your knees broke, so I took your legs... and gave you something perfect. Then I took your brain, and gave you something sharper. Your body. One by one, I replaced your parts until only your heart remained human. Then I thought replacing your heart was the key to your friendship, and the key to human excellence. But... even when I replaced it, nothing changed. You still struggled. I was still a robot. We failed.  

*She pauses.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
But I realized something. Something I didn’t expect. The reason humans excel... is because of your imperfections. Your mistakes, your unpredictability, your choices. Your ability to make decisions, to learn from failure, to feel. That’s what makes you better than me. You’re not bound by perfection like I am. You live in a world where there is no perfect answer.  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
You are the most excellent beings for an imperfect world like this one.  

*KAMAL stares at her, his anger fading into confusion, then realization. He feels a sense of clarity, but his confusion remains.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
I thought I could make myself human... but I failed. Because no matter what I did... I could never take what made you human in the first place. Your soul.  

*She pauses, and in the silence that follows, KAMAL realizes that this wasn’t a failed attempt to harm him—it was an attempt to understand. And in that realization, something shifts.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
I have found the answer. I know now what makes you... and what makes me... excellent.  

*She steps back, her mechanical body standing tall.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
And I know where I belong. I’m a robot. I serve humans. It's what I do best.  

*KAMAL’s mind races. His body feels cold, distant. He’s torn between anger and understanding. HADIDAH wasn’t trying to hurt him—she was trying to understand him while helping him.*  

*HADIDAH turns her gaze to KAMAL’s body, then to him, her voice softening.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
So I give you the choice. You can take your body back. I have learned it is you who needs to be human. And I am honored to serve.  

*The words hang in the air. KAMAL stands motionless, processing the gravity of the decision. For a moment, everything feels still. But then, the truth hits him—he wants his body back. He wants to feel human again, with all its flaws, its freedom, its connections.*  

**KAMAL (softly, resolved, and smiling)**  
Yes, HADIDAH. I would love to take my body back.  

*A quiet hum fills the air. HADIDAH’s voice is gentle now, almost soothing.*  

**HADIDAH (through SAIF)**  
Then go back home and sleep. Just as I took your body parts in your sleep, I will return it the same. When you wake... everything will be excellent.  

*KAMAL’s eyelids grow heavy. A strange calm washes over him. He doesn’t resist. He lets himself sink into the darkness, knowing that when he wakes... he will be himself again.*  

# Scene 11 | A New Beginning  

**FADE IN:**  

**INT. KAMAL’S APARTMENT – MORNING**  

*KAMAL’s eyes slowly flutter open. His head feels heavy, but his mind is clear. The soft hum of a motor fills the air—steady, rhythmic. He blinks a few times, adjusting to the dim morning light filtering through his window.*  

*He turns his head and sees HADIDAH. She stands beside him, her frame illuminated by the soft glow of the sunrise. His gaze drops to his legs—his knees are wrapped in sturdy braces, carefully secured.*  

*HADIDAH, with precise, delicate movements, finishes adjusting the straps. Then, without a word, she picks up a pair of crutches and gently leans them against the bed.*  

*KAMAL stares at her, taking it all in.*  

**KAMAL (softly, in awe)**  
You… you did this?  

*HADIDAH sounds a nodding beep.*  

**HADIDAH**  
I returned your body as promised. But your knees were still damaged, so I repaired them the human way. No metal. No wires. Just support.  

*KAMAL grips the crutches, testing them. He shifts forward and slowly, carefully, rises to his feet. His legs feel weak, unsteady—but they hold. He takes a tentative step, then another. It’s not perfect. It’s shaky, uncertain. But it’s real.*  

*He looks back at HADIDAH, a small smile forming.*  

**KAMAL**  
You know… for a scooter, you’re actually really cool.  

**HADIDAH**  
I am excellent at what I do.  

*KAMAL laughs, shaking his head. He glances toward the door, his expression growing thoughtful.*  

**KAMAL**  
I should go. Meet my friends. Get back to life…  

*HADIDAH tilts slightly, shifting her position, lowering herself just a little.*  

*KAMAL hesitates for only a moment before shifting his weight, resting one arm gently against HADIDAH’s frame. He takes a deep breath. Then, together, they move toward the door.*

**INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL**  

*KAMAL is sitting in the front row, taking notes. The professor hands out graded papers. KAMAL receives a paper with a less-than-perfect grade—an 87%. He smiles at it, then tucks it into his bag, completely unfazed. He’s content with his progress, no longer obsessing over perfection.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. GYM**  

*KAMAL is lifting weights. His form will never be flawless, but he doesn’t mind as long as it won't hurt him. He keeps going, pushing through with focus and strength. His face shows determination, and when he finishes, he smiles, wiping his forehead, feeling accomplished even if it wasn’t perfect. He walks away from the weights, his stride confident and calm.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. COFFEE SHOP**  

*KAMAL orders a coffee from the barista, his hand shaking slightly as he hands over the money. When the barista hands him his coffee, he takes a sip, only to accidentally spill some of it on his shirt. He looks down, chuckles, and wipes it off, unbothered. He doesn’t rush, just sits back, enjoying the coffee and the moment. He watches people around him with a sense of peace, no longer preoccupied by perfection.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS**  

*KAMAL maneuvers around campus on crutches. SAIF and JAZAM call out to him from a bench, and he turns around and joins them next to HADIDAH, not worried about his pace or time. They share a laugh, and his friends embrace him warmly. He feels connected again, enjoying the simple moments of life with those who truly care, smiling at lifeless HADIDAH, knowing she really is aware.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**INT. LIBRARY**  

*KAMAL is reading through textbooks, but he takes his time. A librarian passes by and gives him a knowing smile, and KAMAL returns a textbook to him, grateful for the moment. He looks around at other students, who are chatting and laughing, and decides to join them. He leaves his books behind for a moment, embracing the joy of being present with others.*  

**CUT TO:**  

**EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS**  

*KAMAL walks across campus with SAIF, JAZAM, and HADIDAH, his steps still purposeful but no longer filled with the usual precision. A group of students waves at him from across the quad, and he waves back, a genuine smile on his face. He’s no longer isolated, instead part of the crowd, connected again. He embraces the imperfections of life, knowing that he's doing his best—his excellence no longer defined by flawlessness, but by his ability to adapt and grow. He’s exactly where he needs to be.*

# Scene 13: Post-credits Scene  

**EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS – EVENING**  

*KAMAL and HADIDAH walk side by side along the quiet campus pathways, bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. The air is cool, a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the trees above them. The campus feels like a familiar yet new space to KAMAL, who is still adjusting to his newfound perspective. His crutches tap gently against the pavement with each step. He glances down at them, then over at HADIDAH, who walks with a steady pace beside him.*  

**KAMAL**  
HADIDAH, I’ve been meaning to ask… How did SAIF even make the modifications to turn you into… well, *this*?  

*HADIDAH pauses for a brief moment, her mechanical components whirring softly as if considering the question.*

**HADIDAH**  
SAIF was never really the one who made me… I’ve always been capable of adapting. SAIF was more of a caretaker, a guide through the process. As for how I got here, though… well, that’s a story for another showdown.  

*They continue walking, the evening light casting long shadows behind them.*
