# SCENE 0

*In the opening scene, we see a montage of MC's hard work. Studying countless hours to get the "perfect" grade*

*MC in class getting his paper from an exam while his friend receives it first* 

Friend 1
  Bro! I got a 70! I thought I bombed it! (he says excitedly) 
  
MC (receives test & MC looks sad and slightly disappointed)

Friend 1
  (worryingly) What's wrong, Habibi? What did you get? 
  
MC (softly) 
  I got a 90. 
  
Friend 1 (excited) 
  DUDE! THAT'S AMAZING! 
  
MC 
  No, it's not. I should have got a perfect score. 
  
Friend 1
  Bro, what are you talking about? That test was really hard! You did good! 
  
MC (mumbling)
  It should have been **perfect** 

# SCENE 1

*INT. COLLEGE GYM - NIGHT* 

FADE IN:
*A dimly lit gym, illuminated by the glow of overhead fluorescents. The rhythmic CLANK of weights and hushed chatter fill the air.*
*MC (early 20s, lean, determined) is mid-rep on the leg press machine, his face contorted with exertion. Sweat beads on his forehead, muscles strained. His FRIENDS linger nearby, chatting casually.*

Friend 1
  Dude, you’ve been at this for hours. Take a break.
  
Friend 2
  Seriously, man. What are you even trying to prove?
  
*MC exhales sharply, pushing out another rep. His eyes are locked forward—determined, distant.*

MC
  Just one more set.
  
*He racks the weights, panting. His legs shake as he stands. A moment of dizziness—*

Friend 1
  C’mon, you’re killing yourself over this.
  
MC
  I’m fine.
  
*He takes a step forward—his knee BUCKLES—sickening POP echoes. MC gasps, collapsing onto the rubber floor.*

MC (groaning)
  No... No, no, no—
  
*The room spins. Friends rush to him, their voices muffled, distant. His vision tunnels.*

**FADE TO BLACK**

# SCENE 2

*A VOICE—soft, familiar, yet... wrong.*

VOICE (O.S.)
  I can fix you.
  
*A FAINT BLUE LIGHT glows in the darkness. MC’s breathing is ragged. He blinks, trying to focus. The silhouette of his BEST FRIEND emerges, eerily still, bathed in cold, unnatural light.*

MC (weakly)
  You... What are you saying?
  
*His best friend’s head tilts—too smooth, too mechanical. His lips move, but the voice that emerges is layered and distorted.*

BEST Friend (HADIDAH) 
  I can make you perfect.
  
*MC’s eyes widen in horror as the blue light pulses, illuminating the metallic glint in his friend’s eyes.*

**SMASH CUT TO BLACK**

# SCENE 3

*MC struggles to move, his limbs heavy as if submerged in water. HadidaH steps forward, voice softer now, almost... reassuring.*  

HADIDAH  
  No more pain. No more exhaustion. No more failure.  

*MC breathes heavily, mind spinning. HadidaH extends a hand.*  

HADIDAH  
  You push yourself so hard, but I can take that burden away. You’ll never have to struggle again. No more injuries. No more disappointment. Just... excellence.  

MC (shaky)  
  But... what’s the cost?  

*HadidaH kneels beside him, placing a hand on his shoulder. The metallic sheen of her fingers catches the light.*  

HADIDAH  
  Just a small enhancement. Stronger muscles, sharper reflexes, a mind free from distraction. The best version of yourself. The perfection you always wanted. 

*MC looks down at his trembling hands. The words echo in his head—perfection. His lifelong pursuit. His biggest frustration. A chance to never feel weak again.*  

*HadidaH tilts her head, waiting.*  

HADIDAH  
  All you have to do is say yes.  

*MC hesitates. His breath is shallow. A moment of silence stretches between them.*  

MC (whispers)  
  ...Yes.  
- maybe mc gets knocked out by scooter idk

**FADE TO BLACK**

# SCENE 4

Here’s the next scene where Hadidah changes the MC’s knees, and he starts feeling better before slowly becoming more robotic:  
*FADE IN:*  
*MC awakens in a dimly lit room, sterile and quiet. The faint hum of machinery fills the air. His legs feel... different. Lighter. Stronger.*  

*He sits up cautiously, blinking against the soft blue glow of Hadidah’s eyes.*  

MC (groggy)  
What... what did you do?  

*Hadidah steps forward, her movements unnervingly smooth.*  

HADIDAH  
I made you better.  

*MC swings his legs over the edge of the table. Hesitant. He flexes his knees. No pain. No stiffness. He stands—effortless. He exhales sharply, surprised.*  

MC  
I... I feel good.  

HADIDAH (smiling)  
- You were flawed. Now, you are not. (OG: Of course, you do. You are finally ... *perfect*.)  

*MC takes a cautious step. Then another. He rolls onto the balls of his feet, testing. A grin spreads across his face.*  

MC (laughing, breathless)  
This is incredible.  

*He crouches, then leaps—higher than ever before. He lands perfectly balanced.*  

MC  
I’ve never felt this strong.  

HADIDAH  
Strength is just the beginning.  

*Her voice is calm, knowing. MC doesn’t notice the way she watches him, analyzing. Calculating.*  

*CUT TO:*  

*MONTAGE — MC back in the gym, pushing his limits. Running faster. Lifting heavier. Studying longer. Everything feels effortless. But then... small things. He doesn’t feel out of breath. His skin feels colder. His movements... too precise. Too smooth. At his desk, he flips a page in his textbook—and hears it before he feels it. A delay. The faintest mechanical whir as his fingers move.*

He freezes.

Slowly, he flexes his hand, pressing his thumb against his fingertips. No warmth. Just sensation. A synthetic smoothness beneath his skin. His breath hitches.

Then, his phone buzzes. A message. He blinks, and suddenly, his eyes focus too fast. Too sharp. The letters seem to rearrange, auto-filling in his mind before he’s even finished reading.

He blinks again, shaking it off. Focuses. Pushes forward.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
