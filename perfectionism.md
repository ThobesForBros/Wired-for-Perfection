# SCENE 0

*In the opening scene, we see a montage of MC's hard work. Studying countless hours to get the "perfect" grade*

*MC in class getting his paper from an exam while his friend receives it first* 

Friend 1
  Bro! I got a 70! I thought I bombed it! (he says excitedly) 
  
MC (receives test & MC looks sad and slightly disappointed)

Friend 1
  (worryingly) What's wrong, Habibi? What did you get? 
  
MC (softly) 
  I got a 90. 
  
Friend 1 (excited) 
  DUDE! THAT'S AMAZING! 
  
MC 
  No, it's not. I should have got a perfect score. 
  
Friend 1
  Bro, what are you talking about? That test was really hard! You did good! 
  
MC (mumbling)
  It should have been **perfect** 

# SCENE 1

*INT. COLLEGE GYM - NIGHT* 

FADE IN:
*A dimly lit gym, illuminated by the glow of overhead fluorescents. The rhythmic CLANK of weights and hushed chatter fill the air.*
*MC (early 20s, lean, determined) is mid-rep on the leg press machine, his face contorted with exertion. Sweat beads on his forehead, muscles strained. His FRIENDS linger nearby, chatting casually.*

Friend 1
  Dude, you’ve been at this for hours. Take a break.
  
Friend 2
  Seriously, man. What are you even trying to prove?
  
*MC exhales sharply, pushing out another rep. His eyes are locked forward—determined, distant.*

MC
  Just one more set.
  
*He racks the weights, panting. His legs shake as he stands. A moment of dizziness—*

Friend 1
  C’mon, you’re killing yourself over this.
  
MC
  I’m fine.
  
*He takes a step forward—his knee BUCKLES—sickening POP echoes. MC gasps, collapsing onto the rubber floor.*

MC (groaning)
  No... No, no, no—
  
*The room spins. Friends rush to him, their voices muffled, distant. His vision tunnels.*

**FADE TO BLACK**

# SCENE 2

*A VOICE—soft, familiar, yet... wrong.*

VOICE (O.S.)
  I can fix you.
  
*A FAINT BLUE LIGHT glows in the darkness. MC’s breathing is ragged. He blinks, trying to focus. The silhouette of his BEST FRIEND emerges, eerily still, bathed in cold, unnatural light.*

MC (weakly)
  You... What are you saying?
  
*His best friend’s head tilts—too smooth, too mechanical. His lips move, but the voice that emerges is layered and distorted.*

BEST Friend (HADIDAH) 
  I can make you perfect.
  
*MC’s eyes widen in horror as the blue light pulses, illuminating the metallic glint in his friend’s eyes.*

**SMASH CUT TO BLACK**

# SCENE 3

*MC struggles to move, his limbs heavy as if submerged in water. HadidaH steps forward, voice softer now, almost... reassuring.*  

HADIDAH  
  No more pain. No more exhaustion. No more failure.  

*MC breathes heavily, mind spinning. HadidaH extends a hand.*  

HADIDAH  
  You push yourself so hard, but I can take that burden away. You’ll never have to struggle again. No more injuries. No more disappointment. Just... excellence.  

MC (shaky)  
  But... what’s the cost?  

*HadidaH kneels beside him, placing a hand on his shoulder. The metallic sheen of her fingers catches the light.*  

HADIDAH  
  Just a small enhancement. Stronger muscles, sharper reflexes, a mind free from distraction. The best version of yourself. The perfection you always wanted. 

*MC looks down at his trembling hands. The words echo in his head—perfection. His lifelong pursuit. His biggest frustration. A chance to never feel weak again.*  

*HadidaH tilts her head, waiting.*  

HADIDAH  
  All you have to do is say yes.  

*MC hesitates. His breath is shallow. A moment of silence stretches between them.*  

MC (whispers)  
  ...Yes.  
- maybe mc gets knocked out by scooter idk

**FADE TO BLACK**

# SCENE 4

**FADE IN**

_MC slowly regains consciousness on the gym floor. His head is heavy, and his vision is blurry. The gym's sounds—weights clanking and faint chatter—fill the air. He blinks, trying to clear his vision._

_He tries to sit up, but there's a slight disorientation. His legs, however... feel different. He slowly tests them—bends his knees. There’s no pain. No stiffness. He flexes them a few more times, more confidently now._

MC (_muttering to himself_)
What happened...? HadidaH... where are you!?

_He looks around the gym, but there’s no sign of her. The room seems just like it always does—dimly lit, full of people working out, none of them noticing him as he slowly gets to his feet. He takes a step, then another. There's no pain, no weakness. His legs are solid. He stands taller than before._

MC (_curious_)
What did that scooter do to me?

_After a moment of steadying himself, he walks to the leg press machine, the same one where his leg injury happened. He hesitates for a second, glancing around at the others in the gym. The place feels like it’s moving in slow motion. All his focus is on his legs now._

MC (_whispering to himself_)
My legs, they feel... stronger, it's like there was no pain to begin with

_He sits on the machine and positions his feet. He adjusts the weight, setting it higher than before. A deep breath. He starts pressing. His legs push with no effort. No pain. No strain. He presses again, a bit faster this time, and then again. He feels a rush, something almost primal, but controlled._

MC (_grinning, under his breath_)
This... this feels too easy.

_He continues pressing the weight, increasing his reps. His legs are working in a way he never thought possible, and yet, the movement is fluid. Each press feels effortless, like a machine. The tension in his body builds, but there’s no fatigue. His muscles don't burn. They’re not strained. His focus is intense, but there's a quiet exhilaration that builds._

_He racks the weights and stands up, his heart racing—not from exertion, but from the pure adrenaline of strength he never thought he could have. He stares at his legs, as if they belong to someone else. He takes a few steps forward, testing them again, this time without the machine to hold him._

MC (_laughing, amazed_)
Yes!

_He moves across the gym floor, walking with confidence. No hesitation. He jogs to the far side of the room, just to test it out, but it's too easy. His legs are perfect now. No sign of pain, no tightness. Just fluid motion. He laughs again, this time a little louder, filled with disbelief and excitement._

MC (_grinning, to himself_)
My workouts, they're **excellent**!
