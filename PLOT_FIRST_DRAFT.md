Characters:
- MC (protagonist, we will give him a fitting name later)
- Scooter (starts off by helping the protagonist but later becomes the antagonist, we can keep her name HadidaH)
- Speakers for HadidaH (people who the scooter will control like a puppet so it can get its words across), one will be the MC's best friend. Assume that whenever HadidaH is talking, she's speaking through a person in the room, unless otherwise specified.

Genre: Science Fiction/Horror

Moral: Humans are imperfect (we can turn this into a whole statement), we can only achieve excellence with the understanding that we're imperfect beings

Plot Outline:

Exposition:

- MC is revealed to be a normal college student with regular day to day activities such as hanging out with friends, working on assignments, and gymming

- MC is hard-working on everything he does, though he is regarded by his friends to be "too" hardworking, and it is shown through the immense work he puts into everything he does and this puts him in constant stress

Rising Action:

- MC doesn't get the best scores that he wants, perhaps he gets a B or even an A-, he's unsatisfied with his gains even though he's still working out really hard

- Friends keep reminding him that he's doing just fine and should be letting a little loose

Trigger Event:

- In the heat of what MC thinks are bad grades and an overall unsatisfactory life, MC begins working out too hard and ultimately gets a knee injury  

- In excruciating pain, MC blacks out

Aftermath:

- We can darken/blacken the room MC is in to set the tone to sort of show that we're in the MC's head at this point

- MC shouts in agony that he's been working extremely hard but is still failing at everything he tries to achieve

- MC hears a voice saying that it can fix him, MC recognizes it to be his best friend's voice and turns looking for him, calling for his name

- MC follows the voice, crawling due to his injury and finds his best friend there

- MC's best friend is emotionless while talking so MC asks what happened

- MC's best friend says how he isn't who MC thinks he is and tells MC that he's "down here"

- After a bit, MC figures out that it's his best friend's scooter speaking through his best friend's body

- The scooter reveals her name as HadidaH and assures MC that his best friend is fine and won't know what happened when HadidaH stops controlling him

- HadidaH tells MC that she can help him get better, and that she can start by fixing his knees

- MC asks HadidaH what she has to gain and she assures him that she's getting exactly what she wants out of this, but only if MC can agree to the help offered to him, and that MC can always ask HadidaH for help.

- MC agrees and the movie cuts to a transition from the black room to the real world, likely a bright light effect which takes up the entire screen and fades out to the gym setting exactly where the MC previously fainted

Falling Action:

- MC is at the gym and feels much better. Working out his legs is much easier, he wonders what else HadidaH can help him with

- As the plot moves forward, MC asks HadidaH for help with several things and Hadidah helps every time. Likely, we'll make it so that HadidaH tells the main character to sleep in order for HadidaH to "fix" the MC, HadidaH's fixing doesn't take effect until the main character wakes up from a nap or something (logically explains when HadidaH has time to make the "modifications" on MC  )

Rising Action #2:

- While MC is able to perform well on exams and works out just fine, he notices that his friendships are starting to diminish, including his best friend. (Not sure how MC should feel at this point, maybe MC won't care at first because at this point MC probably only sees people as tools for his own success and has no reason for friends)

- Regardless of the previous note, at some point the MC needs to regret his perfection due to his loneliness.

- This surge of emotion sends him down a path of regret though he's still able to do everything perfectly

- He asks HadidaH for help with making friends again, and she says she might be able to help, audience should be able to tell HadidaH is iffy here and that she might actually have no idea how to help with that, but it is clear that she tries to help him anyway by the next time MC wakes up

- After MC wakes up, things are odd, in that things were exactly the same as yesterday. It becomes clear that HadidaH wasn't able to help the main character get his friends back

- Somehow, someway, whether due to extreme sense of emotion which is contrary to the roboticness of the perfectionist that the main character had become or by some other means, MC is able to see what's become of him

Climax:

- MC senses something is deeply wrong with him. He rolls up his sleeves and finds nothing but metal and wires. He had turned into a robot.

Aftermath:

- MC realizes at this point why he became so good at everything, because he literally turned into a robot and could conduct tasks with perfection

- Well, good at everything besides a social life. He was so robotic that he lost any sense of emotion necessary for a friendship. 

- MC realized the error of his ways, and sought to change and learn to work hard without the perfectionism, to let loose a little and destress in his pursuit for excellence. 

- However, MC can do none of it without his original body, he needed it back, and in a fit of rage, searches everywhere for HadidaH

(Epic) Chase Scene:

- MC finds HadidaH in the distance and screams her name and starts chasing her

- HadidaH, seemingly concerned, speeds off using MC's best friend and MC keeps chasing her

- We're gonna see how epic we can possibly make this chase scene around campus it'll be sick

- After a while of chasing HadidaH with her speeding into a building and then into a room, MC, upon entering the room, thinks he cornered HadidaH, but finds her and MC's best friend (still under her control) standing still and looking at MC as he enters.

Falling Action:

- MC shouts to HadidaH asking where his body is and what she did with it, and so HadidaH brings out his body from someplace in that room (implying she was taking him to his body)

- Through MC's best friend, HadidaH explains how even though robots are so perfect in everything they do, she couldn't figure out the answer as to why humans remain superior to robots. 

- HadidaH says how she wanted to turn herself into a human to find out why, and that by replacing MC's body parts with robotic parts, she would not only find out the secret as to why humans excel, but she'd also be helping MC achieve his own success at the same time. 

- However, HadidaH came to the realization that the reason why humans are so successful is because of their imperfections. Humans have the consciousness and freedom to make their own decisions. Humans live on a world where there is never a perfect answer to anything. Humans are the most excellent beings for an imperfect world like this one. [Insert whatever other inspirational words HadidaH can use in her speech]

- HadidaH tells MC that she had failed to replicate a human because she could never take away what made MC a living and breathing human to begin with, which was his soul. However, she says that she had found the answer to the excellence of humans, and that she had found where she is excellent, too (implying that she will happily continue to serve as a robot)

- HadidaH gives MC one final choice to take his body, he accepts and the screen turns bright white

Resolution:

- MC wakes up in the hospital. He's got the IV and everything, and we'll add a (fictional) EEG headset (brain helmet things on his head that's meant to sense brain activity and whatever). Concerned, but hopeful, he rolls up his sleeve and finds that he's no longer a robot

- MC hears a voice next to him saying how glad he is that MC finally woke up, and MC finds his best friend (not controlled by HadidaH, though he's holding HadidaH) is right next to him

- MC, excited (and still lying down), seems to make an attempt to hug his best friend but hugs HadidaH instead   thanking HadidaH. 

- Best friend, a little confused, says how he found MC at the gym in pain, immediately drove him to the hospital, and waited for his recovery

- MC realizes it was all a dream but is still determined to make things right and try his best to be the best human he can be, and not the best robot he could never be

Credits/Epilogue:

- During the credits section, in the background we can show a montage of the main character making things right and doing assignments and working out and hanging out with friends the way he was meant to, and stress free too. He notices an increase in grades, too, as he is unstressed while still maintaining hard work

Post-credits Scene:

- Here, we can cut to a scene of MC's best friend with his scooter HadidaH. MC's best friend tells HadidaH that he's glad everything worked out in the end for MC. HadidaH wakes up and (happily) says (in her just-now revealed natural voice) "Let's just say I did everything you [MC's best friend] asked me to :D" (top ten sigma quotes), and brings out the EEG headset in a way that shows that she was controlling it during the whole plot, which explains how MC's dream even worked in the first place (a small humerus end twist that'll certainly leave the audience asking a ton of questions   but also explains how HadidaH really did find her path in being a robot with her final quote).
